# Testing Strategy: Testnet vs Mainnet

## ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE: Base Sepolia Has Low Liquidity

**Discovery:** Uniswap interface doesn't support Base Sepolia, and testnet pools have very low/no liquidity.

**The Reality:**
- ‚ùå Uniswap web interface doesn't support Base Sepolia testnet
- ‚ùå WETH/USDC pool on testnet has insufficient liquidity for swaps
- ‚ùå Getting testnet USDC is difficult (faucets limited/unavailable)
- ‚úÖ Your swap script works perfectly - just needs liquidity!

## üéØ Two Paths Forward

### Option 1: Switch to Base Mainnet (RECOMMENDED)

**Why mainnet is better for testing:**
- ‚úÖ Deep liquidity - swaps work instantly
- ‚úÖ Real price discovery and fees
- ‚úÖ Realistic testing environment
- ‚úÖ Your swap script works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Use tiny amounts ($10-20) for safe testing

**Cost:** ~$50-100 total for complete testing
**Time:** 30 minutes to full deployment
**Reliability:** 100% - everything works

### Option 2: Stay on Testnet

**Challenges:**
- Need to find USDC faucet or bridge
- Limited liquidity in pools
- Uniswap interface doesn't support it
- More time debugging than testing

**When it makes sense:**
- You want zero real money risk
- You're willing to spend time finding testnet USDC
- You're okay with occasional transaction failures

## ÔøΩ Switching to Base Mainnet (Recommended Path)

### Step 1: Update Configuration

Edit your `.env` file:
```bash
BASE_CHAIN_ID=8453
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

Edit `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
network:
  name: "Base"
  chain_id: 8453  # Mainnet
  rpc_url: "https://mainnet.base.org"

uniswap:
  factory_address: "0x33128a8fC17869897dcE68Ed026d694621f6FDfD"
  position_manager_address: "0x03a520b32C04BF3bEEf7BEb72E919cf822Ed34f1"
  router_address: "0x2626664c2603336E57B271c5C0b26F421741e481"
```

### Step 2: Bridge ETH to Base Mainnet

If you don't have ETH on Base mainnet:
1. Visit https://bridge.base.org/
2. Bridge 0.05-0.1 ETH from Ethereum mainnet
3. Takes ~10 minutes
4. Cost: ~$5-10 in bridge fees

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

```bash
# Verify connection
python3 scripts/check_testnet.py  # Will now show mainnet

# Wrap some ETH
python3 scripts/wrap_eth.py --amount 0.01

# Swap to USDC (will work instantly!)
python3 scripts/swap_tokens.py --from WETH --to USDC --amount 0.005
```

### Step 4: Create Your First LP Position

```bash
python3 scripts/test_create_position.py
```

This will work perfectly on mainnet with real liquidity!

## üí∞ Mainnet Testing Budget

**Minimal Testing ($50-80):**
- 0.05 ETH total (~$200)
- Wrap: 0.01 ETH
- Swap: 0.005 WETH ‚Üí USDC
- LP Position: $20 worth
- Gas fees: ~0.005 ETH total
- Remaining: 0.03 ETH buffer

**Comprehensive Testing ($150-200):**
- 0.1 ETH total (~$400)
- Multiple positions
- Test rebalancing
- Test fee collection
- Full strategy testing

## üîç If You Want to Stay on Testnet

Here are the actual options:

### Option A: Circle USDC Faucet
- Visit: https://faucet.circle.com/
- Select Base Sepolia (if available)
- Get free testnet USDC

### Option B: Base Discord
- Join: https://discord.gg/buildonbase
- Go to #faucet channel
- Request testnet USDC
- Community usually helpful

### Option C: Bridge from Ethereum Sepolia
- Get USDC on Ethereum Sepolia
- Bridge to Base Sepolia via https://bridge.base.org/

### Option D: Manual Contract Interaction
- Use Basescan to interact with USDC contract directly
- Call `mint()` function if it's available (some testnet tokens have public mint)

### Phase 2: Small Test Position (10 minutes)

Test with small amounts first:

```bash
# Create tiny position: $10 worth
python scripts/run_optimizer.py \
  --pool WETH-USDC \
  --capital 10 \
  --once

# What happens:
# 1. Fetches real price from CoinGecko
# 2. Calculates optimal range
# 3. Creates REAL position on testnet
# 4. You get a REAL transaction hash
# 5. View on: https://sepolia.basescan.org/
```

### Phase 3: Test Rebalancing (1 hour)

Run continuous monitoring:

```bash
# Monitor every 5 minutes, rebalance if needed
python scripts/run_optimizer.py \
  --pool WETH-USDC \
  --capital 50 \
  --interval 300

# Wait for price to move
# Optimizer automatically rebalances when profitable
```

### Phase 4: Test All Features (1 day)

```bash
# Test different strategies
python scripts/run_optimizer.py \
  --strategy multi_position \
  --pool WETH-USDC \
  --capital 100 \
  --interval 300

# Run overnight
# Check logs and performance in the morning
```

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

### Testnet (FREE):
- Test ETH: **$0** (from faucet)
- Gas costs: **$0** (test network)
- Risk: **$0** (not real money)
- Transactions: **Unlimited**

### Mainnet (With $20 Real ETH):
- Capital: **$20** (real money!)
- Gas per rebalance: **~$0.10-0.50**
- Risk: **Medium** (could lose if price moves badly)
- Rebalances: **~40-200** (depending on gas)

## üéì What You'll Learn on Testnet

1. **How tight ranges work**
   - See how ¬±1% range captures fees
   - Watch what happens when price moves out of range

2. **Rebalancing timing**
   - When does optimizer trigger rebalance?
   - How much does it cost vs. potential fees?

3. **Gas optimization**
   - Is Base really 100x cheaper than Ethereum? (Yes!)
   - How gas affects profitability

4. **Strategy comparison**
   - Concentrated vs. Multi-position
   - Which works better for your capital size?

5. **Edge cases**
   - What happens in high volatility?
   - How does optimizer handle low liquidity?

## üöÄ Recommended Path

### Week 1: Testnet Only
```bash
Day 1: Get test tokens, create first position ($10)
Day 2: Test rebalancing logic ($50 position)
Day 3-7: Run continuously, monitor, adjust parameters
```

### Week 2: Small Mainnet Test
```bash
# Once confident, try mainnet with tiny amount
python scripts/run_optimizer.py \
  --pool WETH-USDC \
  --capital 20 \  # Just $20 real money
  --interval 300

# Run for a week
# Verify profitability before scaling up
```

### Week 3+: Scale Up
```bash
# If profitable, gradually increase
$20 ‚Üí $50 ‚Üí $100 ‚Üí $500 ‚Üí $1000+
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Testnet Differences

| Feature | Testnet | Mainnet |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Liquidity** | Low (few users) | High (millions) |
| **Slippage** | Higher (~1-2%) | Lower (~0.1-0.5%) |
| **Prices** | Can be off | Real-time accurate |
| **Volume** | Low | High |
| **Fees Earned** | Lower | Higher |

**Why this matters:** Your testnet results might show lower fees than mainnet because there's less trading volume. But the LOGIC and TIMING will be the same!

## üìä Success Metrics

### On Testnet, Verify:
- [ ] Positions create successfully
- [ ] Transactions confirm (view on explorer)
- [ ] Rebalancing triggers at right time
- [ ] Gas costs are acceptable (<2% of position)
- [ ] No errors in 24hr run
- [ ] Logging captures all activity

### Before Mainnet:
- [ ] Ran successfully for 7+ days on testnet
- [ ] Understand all strategy parameters
- [ ] Verified gas optimization
- [ ] Comfortable with risk/reward
- [ ] Started with <$50 real money

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

I'm adding the full Uniswap V3 ABIs right now so you can:

1. **Get test USDC** (swap script coming)
2. **Create real testnet positions**
3. **Test full rebalancing cycle**
4. **Collect testnet fees**
5. **Verify everything works**

Then when you're confident: deploy $20 on mainnet and scale from there!

## üéØ Bottom Line

**You DO NOT need real money to test!**

- Base Sepolia has full Uniswap V3 deployment
- Use FREE test ETH (you have 0.1 ETH already!)
- Test everything risk-free
- Once confident ‚Üí start small on mainnet ($10-20)
- Scale up gradually as you prove profitability

**Recommended:** Test on testnet for at least a week before using any real money!
