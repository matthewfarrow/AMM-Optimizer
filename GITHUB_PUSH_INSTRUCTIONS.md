# GitHub Push Instructions

Your code is ready to push! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `AMM-Optimizer` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: `Automated liquidity provider optimizer for Blackhole DEX on Avalanche`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. Click "Create repository"

4. Copy the repository URL (should be something like `https://github.com/matthewfarrow/AMM-Optimizer.git`)

5. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/mattfarrow/GitRepos/AMM-Optimizer
git remote add origin https://github.com/matthewfarrow/AMM-Optimizer.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Create Repository via GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
cd /Users/mattfarrow/GitRepos/AMM-Optimizer
gh repo create AMM-Optimizer --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## What's Already Done ✅

- ✅ Git initialized
- ✅ All files added and committed
- ✅ Branch renamed to 'main'
- ✅ Git user configured (matthewfarrow / matthewfarrow64@icloud.com)

## What's in the Commit

The initial commit includes:
- Complete modular architecture
- 3 LP strategies (Concentrated Follower, Multi-Position, Multi-Pool framework)
- Optimization engine with volatility analysis
- Web3 integration for Avalanche
- Full documentation (README, QUICKSTART, IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES, PROJECT_SUMMARY)
- Configuration system
- Backtesting framework
- Example scripts

Total: 28 files, 3,442 lines of code

## After Pushing

Once pushed, your repository will be available at:
`https://github.com/matthewfarrow/AMM-Optimizer`

You can then:
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Enable GitHub Pages for documentation
- Add issue templates
- Set up branch protection rules
- Invite collaborators

## Troubleshooting

If you get authentication errors:
1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. You may need to use a Personal Access Token instead of password
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate new token (classic) with 'repo' scope
   - Use the token as your password when prompted

Or use SSH instead:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:matthewfarrow/AMM-Optimizer.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Ready to Push!

Just create the repository on GitHub and run the push command. Let me know if you need any help!
