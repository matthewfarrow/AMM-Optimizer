## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Smart Contract Deployment

#### 1.1 Deploy to Base Sepolia (Testing)
```bash
# Set environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
export BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.base.org"

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia

# Note the deployed contract address
# Example: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

#### 1.2 Verify Contracts
```bash
# Verify on Basescan
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

#### 1.3 Deploy to Base Mainnet
```bash
# Deploy to Base Mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network base

# Verify on Basescan
npx hardhat verify --network base <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### Step 2: Backend Deployment (Railway)

#### 2.1 Create Railway Project
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Create new project
railway init
```

#### 2.2 Configure Environment Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db

# Base Network
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org

# Contract Addresses
UNISWAP_V3_POSITION_MANAGER=0x03a520b32C04BF3bEEf7BFdF5497F0D5c9b18b5b
UNISWAP_V3_ROUTER=0x2626664c2603336E57B271c5C0b26F421741e481
LIQUIDITY_MANAGER_ADDRESS=<YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

# Private Key (for monitoring)
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>

# Backend Configuration
BACKEND_PORT=8000
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

#### 2.3 Deploy Backend
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway up

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs
```

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

#### 3.1 Create Vercel Project
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy frontend
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

#### 3.2 Configure Environment Variables
Set these in Vercel dashboard:

```bash
# WalletConnect
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>

# Backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

# Contract Addresses
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_BASE=<YOUR_MAINNET_CONTRACT>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_BASE_SEPOLIA=<YOUR_TESTNET_CONTRACT>

# Environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Step 4: Monitoring Service Setup

#### 4.1 Deploy Monitoring Service
```bash
# Create monitoring service in Railway
railway add

# Set environment variables
railway variables set MONITORING_ENABLED=true
railway variables set CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

#### 4.2 Start Monitoring
```bash
# Deploy monitoring service
railway up --service monitoring
```

## ðŸ§ª Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Test Smart Contracts
```bash
# Test on Base Sepolia
npx hardhat test --network baseSepolia

# Test on Base Mainnet
npx hardhat test --network base
```

### 2. Test Backend API
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health

# Test pools endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/pools

# Test whitelist
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/whitelist/status/0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

### 3. Test Frontend
```bash
# Visit your Vercel URL
# Test wallet connection
# Test pool selection
# Test strategy configuration
```

### 4. Test End-to-End
1. Connect wallet on frontend
2. Select a pool
3. Configure strategy
4. Deploy position
5. Verify position appears in monitoring
