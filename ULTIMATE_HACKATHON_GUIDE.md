- TVL: $8.3M, APR: 72.62%

#### Step 4: Configure Strategy
- Go to "Configure Strategy" tab
- Enter amount: **$0.01** (1 cent)
- Tick range: **500** (5% range)
- Verify amount1 auto-calculates

#### Step 5: Create Position
- Click "Create Position"
- **WATCH CONSOLE LOGS** (F12 → Console)
- Look for emoji indicators:
  - 🚀 = Position creation started
  - 💰 = Price data
  - 🎯 = Tick calculations
  - 📋 = Transaction parameters
  - ✅ = Success
  - ❌ = Error

#### Step 6: Monitor Transaction
- MetaMask will pop up
- Check gas fee (should be < $0.01)
- If "Transaction likely to fail" appears, check console logs
- If rate limited, wait 1-2 minutes and retry

### 🔍 DEBUGGING TIPS:

#### Browser Console Logs
Open Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for:
```
🔄 calculateTokenAmounts called: {...}
💰 Current price: 3849.86
🎯 Tick bounds: {...}
🚀 createPosition called: {...}
📋 Creating position with params: {...}
```

#### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"Transaction likely to fail"**
   - Check console logs for specific error
   - Verify pool address exists on BaseScan
   - Ensure sufficient token balance

2. **"Rate limited"**
   - Wait 1-2 minutes
   - Retry the transaction
   - App has built-in retry logic

3. **High gas fees**
   - Should be < $0.01 on Base
   - If higher, check network congestion
   - Try again in a few minutes

4. **Position not appearing on Uniswap**
   - Check transaction hash on BaseScan
   - Verify transaction succeeded
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for indexing

### 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ Transaction succeeds (no "likely to fail")
- ✅ Gas fee < $0.01
- ✅ Position created successfully
- ✅ Position visible on Uniswap
- ✅ Console logs show success

### 🚨 EMERGENCY DEBUGGING:

If something goes wrong:
